## Key Features Showcase

### Elliptical Orbit and Seasonal Changes

This model accurately simulates Earth's elliptical orbit and axial tilt, creating correct seasonal characteristics in the northern hemisphere during perihelion (winter) and aphelion (summer).

### Atmospheric Scattering Effect

Using physically accurate Rayleigh scattering algorithm to simulate atmospheric scattering of sunlight, creating orange-red light during sunrise/sunset and blue sky effect.

### Moon Tidal Locking

The Moon implements accurate tidal locking, always showing the same face toward Earth while maintaining the correct orbital inclination.
